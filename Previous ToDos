 Done! Your repository is now live at
  https://github.com/temeraire/ai-experiments with all your code
  pushed to the main branch.

> Great! I'd like to ask for a new  feature. \
When I switch models, it would be handy for me to have the context
 automatically passed to the new model. My goal here is to compare
 how different models handle the same request. 

  Now let me create a plan for adding this feature:

⏺ I've analyzed the code. Currently when you switch models
  mid-conversation, the context (conversation history) is already
  automatically passed to the new model because:
  1. The conversation's messages list (line 85) stores all
  user/assistant exchanges
  2. When you send a message with any model, it includes the full
  history: conv.messages + [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
  (line 672)

  However, what's missing is a clear way to compare how different
  models respond to the same request.

  Here's my plan:

  1. Create a new git branch for this feature
  2. Add a "Resend to Different Model" button for each user
  message that lets you send the same prompt to a different model
  3. Display both responses side-by-side for easy comparison
  4. Preserve all responses in the conversation history

  Does this approach sound good to you?

> Well let me tell you why I made this request. I started out 
using mistral:7b. Here's what is noted at the bottom of my 
request:\
Turn 1 • mistral:7b • 14.97s\
\
And here's the request I made: \
Can you  suggest optimizations for the attached jupyter notebook?\
\
I uploaded the notebook. \
\
Then I switched to qwen. Here's my chat submission:\
Switching to qwen. Can you  suggest optimizations for the attached
 jupyter notebook?

qwen2.5:32b-instruct\
\
And here's what it responded:\
\
Sure, I can help optimize a Jupyter Notebook that performs image 
augmentation using OpenCV and other Python libraries. Since you 
haven't provided the actual code from your Jupyter Notebook, I'll 
provide some general optimization suggestions based on common 
practices...\
\
So it doesn't look like anything persisted. 

⏺ Ah, I see the issue now! When you switch models, the
  conversation context (previous messages) should be passed
  automatically based on the code at line 672, but there are two
  potential problems:

  1. The uploaded file content might not persist - When you
  uploaded the notebook in the first message, that content was
  added to your prompt text. But when you switched models and sent
   a new message, you only typed the text without re-uploading the
   file, so the new model didn't have access to the notebook
  content.
  2. The model might not be using the conversation history 
  effectively - Even though the backend sends the full message
  history, the model might not be referencing it properly.

  Let me verify what's actually happening by checking the
  conversation flow. The issue is most likely that file uploads 
  only affect the current message - they're not stored in the
  conversation context for subsequent messages.

  Here's my updated plan:

  1. Create a new git branch for this feature
  2. Store uploaded file content in the conversation object so it
  persists across model switches
  3. Add a "Resend with different model" button that sends the
  exact same prompt (including any uploaded files) to a different
  model
  4. Display the comparison between different model responses
  5. Test with your use case (uploading a notebook and comparing
  model responses)

  Does this better address what you need?

> Yes. The other thing you should know is that when I attached the
 .ipynb file, it actually inserted the entire text of the file 
into the chat window. I'd prefer that it not do that -- that it 
just shows the name of the file, which you can click if you want 
to look at it, just the way that I can with ChatGPT or Claude. 

⏺ Perfect! So I need to:

  1. Fix file upload UX - Show file as a clickable chip/badge
  instead of inserting all content into the textarea
  2. Store uploaded files in conversation context so they persist
  across messages and model switches
  3. Add "Resend with different model" feature for comparing
  responses

  Let me update my plan:

⏺ Here's my plan:

  1. Create new git branch for model-switching feature

  2. Refactor file upload UX
  - Show uploaded files as clickable chips/badges (like
  ChatGPT/Claude)
  - Don't insert file content into textarea
  - Allow clicking chip to view file content in a modal/dialog

  3. Store uploaded files in conversation context
  - Add files array to Conversation class
  - Files persist across all messages in the conversation

  4. Include files in messages sent to models
  - Backend automatically includes all conversation files with
  each prompt
  - Model receives full context including files

  5. Add "Resend with different model" feature
  - Button on each user message to resend to a different model
  - Preserves the exact prompt and any files from that message
  - Shows responses side-by-side for comparison

  6. Test with your notebook scenario

  Does this plan look good?

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully implemented all the features. Here's
  what changed:

  Summary of Changes:

  1. File Upload UX Improved

  - Files now appear as clickable chips above the message box, not
   inserted into the textarea
  - Shows file name and size in a clean badge format
  - Files can be clicked to view info or removed with the X button

  2. Files Stored in Conversation Context

  - Added files array to the Conversation class
  - All uploaded files persist throughout the entire conversation
  - Files are automatically included with every message sent to
  any model

  3. Automatic Context Passing

  - When you send a message, the backend automatically prepends
  all uploaded files to your prompt
  - This happens transparently - models receive full file context
  with every request
  - Works across model switches - no need to re-upload

  4. "Resend with Different Model" Feature

  - Each user message now has a dropdown: "Resend to different
  model..."
  - Select any available model to resend the exact same prompt
  - Perfect for comparing how different models handle the same
  request
  - All uploaded files are automatically included

  How to Use:

  1. Start a new conversation
  2. Upload your notebook file (it appears as a chip, not in the
  textarea)
  3. Type your question: "Can you suggest optimizations for the
  attached jupyter notebook?"
  4. Send to mistral:7b
  5. After getting the response, click the "Resend to different
  model..." dropdown on your user message
  6. Select qwen2.5:32b-instruct
  7. Both responses will appear in the chat for easy comparison!

  The server starts successfully. Ready to test with your real use
   case!

> Can you tell me what you mean by "YouTube-ready with 
comprehensive tracking"? 

⏺ By "YouTube-ready with comprehensive tracking," I mean that the
  logging system already captures and organizes all the data you'd
   need for creating YouTube content about your LLM experiments:

  What Makes It YouTube-Ready:

  1. Comprehensive Data Capture

  - Every conversation is recorded with timestamps, models used,
  prompts, and responses
  - Turn-by-turn tracking shows the progression of conversations
  - Multiple export formats (HTML, Markdown, DOCX) for easy
  insertion into video editing software or presentation tools

  2. Visual Documentation

  - HTML exports can be displayed on screen during videos
  - Markdown files for clean, formatted text overlays
  - Browser-based UI that looks good for screen recording
  demonstrations

  3. Performance Metrics

  - Response times are tracked for each query (great for comparing
   model speeds)
  - Model comparison data when you test the same prompt across
  different models
  - Duration tracking shows how long conversations last

  4. Organized File Structure

  conversations/
  ├── conv_2024-10-16_experiment1/
  │   ├── turn_001_hello_world/     # Easy to navigate on camera
  │   ├── turn_002_code_review/      # Clear naming for demos
  │   └── conversation_summary.json  # Stats for video overlays

  5. Content Creation Benefits

  - Before/After comparisons: Test same prompts on different
  models
  - Time-lapse demonstrations: Show conversation evolution
  - Statistical analysis: Response times, token counts, model
  preferences
  - Clean exports: Professional-looking outputs for B-roll footage
  - Reproducible experiments: Everything logged for follow-up
  videos

  Example YouTube Use Cases:

  - "Claude vs Llama vs Qwen: Speed & Quality Comparison"
  - "Testing 10 Coding Prompts Across 5 Models"
  - "Real-time AI Conversation Analysis"
  - Tutorial series showing the UI and demonstrating different
  models

  The system essentially creates a complete audit trail of your AI
   experiments that can be easily transformed into educational
  content, with all the metadata you'd want to display
  (timestamps, models, performance metrics) already captured and
  formatted.


> In plan mode: I'd like to have this same functionality available
 for Claude code. Is this possible, and if so, do you recommend 
that we have a separate program, or that we use the same one? Here
 is more on why I'm interested in this:\
When the context window gets too full, it flickers crazily and 
sometimes results in the program crashing. Is it possible to 
create an interface that runs (say) in the browser. I would want 
the following features: 1) After each request that I make, both my
 request and response would be written to a file on my mac. 2) At 
the same time, the /clear command would be run I'm running some 
experiments using a local LLM (qwen2.5:32b-instruct). It uses 
Ollama and is running in the terminal. Questions: 3) My current 
workflow is to enter a prompt or copy a document into the 
terminal, then await the output in markdown, then go to 
daringfireball.com and convert the raw markdown into HTML, and 
then copy and paste the HTML into a MS Word document. I can't be 
doing that all the time. Is there a way to automate this process, 
i.e. converting markdown into text that I could then use in a Word
 document or Excel spreadsheet? 4) I'd like to record things like:
 Date, Time of Day, model used, prompt used, result. I'm also 
planning to use some of this for a YouTube series.

     │ I recommend extending the existing application rather than    │
     │ creating a separate one because:                              │
     │ - All core functionality is already implemented               │
     │ - The architecture is API-agnostic (just needs different      │
     │ endpoints)                                                    │
     │ - Unified interface for both Ollama and Claude models         │
     │ - Shared logging/tracking infrastructure                      │
     │                                                               │

> Can you tell me what you mean by "YouTube-ready with 
comprehensive tracking"? 

⏺ By "YouTube-ready with comprehensive tracking," I mean that the
  logging system already captures and organizes all the data you'd
   need for creating YouTube content about your LLM experiments:

  What Makes It YouTube-Ready:

  1. Comprehensive Data Capture

  - Every conversation is recorded with timestamps, models used,
  prompts, and responses
  - Turn-by-turn tracking shows the progression of conversations
  - Multiple export formats (HTML, Markdown, DOCX) for easy
  insertion into video editing software or presentation tools

  2. Visual Documentation

  - HTML exports can be displayed on screen during videos
  - Markdown files for clean, formatted text overlays
  - Browser-based UI that looks good for screen recording
  demonstrations

  3. Performance Metrics

  - Response times are tracked for each query (great for comparing
   model speeds)
  - Model comparison data when you test the same prompt across
  different models
  - Duration tracking shows how long conversations last

  4. Organized File Structure

  conversations/
  ├── conv_2024-10-16_experiment1/
  │   ├── turn_001_hello_world/     # Easy to navigate on camera
  │   ├── turn_002_code_review/      # Clear naming for demos
  │   └── conversation_summary.json  # Stats for video overlays

  5. Content Creation Benefits

  - Before/After comparisons: Test same prompts on different
  models
  - Time-lapse demonstrations: Show conversation evolution
  - Statistical analysis: Response times, token counts, model
  preferences
  - Clean exports: Professional-looking outputs for B-roll footage
  - Reproducible experiments: Everything logged for follow-up
  videos

  Example YouTube Use Cases:

  - "Claude vs Llama vs Qwen: Speed & Quality Comparison"
  - "Testing 10 Coding Prompts Across 5 Models"
  - "Real-time AI Conversation Analysis"
  - Tutorial series showing the UI and demonstrating different
  models

  The system essentially creates a complete audit trail of your AI
   experiments that can be easily transformed into educational
  content, with all the metadata you'd want to display
  (timestamps, models, performance metrics) already captured and
  formatted.

> I'm currently on the Max plan. Does that mean I'm rate-limited 
by token count? And will this be able to estimate tokens left 
before rate limits are reached? How will it handle these things if
 I switch among Claude models? 

⏺ Great questions about Claude's rate limiting! Let me research
  the current rate limits for the Max plan and how we could handle
   token tracking.

⏺ Web Search("Claude API Max plan rate limits tokens 2024 anthropic
            pricing")
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> We can proceed with your search but it should be 2025 anthropic 
pricing, not 2024 

⏺ Web Search("Claude API Max plan rate limits tokens 2025 anthropic
            pricing")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 27s                                         

⏺ Based on this research, yes, you are rate-limited by token count
   on the Max plan. Here's how the enhanced logger could handle
  this:

  Token Tracking & Rate Limit Management Features

  1. Real-time Token Counting

  The system would:
  - Use tiktoken or Anthropic's tokenizer to estimate tokens
  BEFORE sending
  - Display estimated token cost for each message
  - Track cumulative tokens used in current conversation
  - Show remaining tokens before hitting rate limits

  2. Multi-Model Rate Limit Tracking

  Since different Claude models have different limits:
  Rate Limit Dashboard:
  ├── Claude Opus 4.1: 15,000/35,000 tokens used (43%)
  ├── Claude Sonnet 4.1: 45,000/280,000 tokens used (16%)
  └── Weekly reset in: 4 days 12 hours

  3. Smart Model Switching

  When switching between models, the system would:
  - Warn if approaching limits on target model
  - Suggest alternative models with more capacity
  - Track usage separately per model
  - Preserve conversation context across model switches

  4. Rate Limit Prevention

  - Pre-flight checks: Estimate if your message will exceed limits
  - Auto-throttling: Delay requests if approaching per-minute
  limits
  - Chunking: Break large requests into smaller pieces
  - Fallback options: Suggest switching to Ollama models if Claude
   limits reached

  5. Usage Analytics

  Visual displays showing:
  - Token usage over time (hourly/daily/weekly graphs)
  - Cost tracking (based on API pricing)
  - Model efficiency comparisons (tokens per response)
  - Prediction of when limits will reset

  6. Context Window Management

  For long conversations:
  - Auto-summarization when approaching context limits
  - Selective history preservation (keep important context, drop
  filler)
  - Warning before context overflow
  - Option to export and start fresh conversation while
  maintaining reference

  This would solve your flickering/crashing issue by:
  - Preventing context overflow before it happens
  - Giving you control over what stays in context
  - Automatically managing the conversation window
  - Providing clear visibility into usage and limits

  The system would essentially act as a "budget manager" for your
  Claude API usage, helping you maximize value from your Max plan
  subscription.

> OK. One more question and then I'll want to switch to Sonnet 4.5
 for execution. I thought my rate limit plan gets reset every five
 hours, not weekly. 

⏺ You're absolutely correct! I apologize for the confusion. Let me
   clarify the rate limit structure:

  Claude Rate Limits - Corrected Information

  Two-Tier Rate Limit System

  Claude actually has BOTH types of limits:

  1. 5-Hour Rolling Limits (Primary)
    - Your main usage resets every 5 hours
    - This is what you'll hit most often
    - Applies to all Claude Pro and Max plans
    - This is the limit that affects your day-to-day usage
  2. Weekly Limits (Secondary cap)
    - Added in August 2025 as an additional ceiling
    - Only affects heavy power users (less than 5% of subscribers)
    - Prevents extreme usage patterns
    - Most users never hit this limit

  How It Works for You

  - Normal usage: After hitting your limit, wait up to 5 hours for
   reset
  - The 5-hour window is rolling: Tokens are replenished
  continuously, not all at once
  - Weekly limit: Only comes into play if you max out multiple
  5-hour windows consistently

  For the Logger System

  This means the token tracking would show:
  Current Usage:
  ├── 5-Hour Window: 12,000/50,000 tokens (24%)
  │   └── Resets: ~3.5 hours remaining
  ├── Weekly Usage: 180,000/1,000,000 tokens (18%)
  │   └── Resets: Monday 12:00 AM
  └── Available Now: 38,000 tokens

  The system would primarily track the 5-hour window since that's
  what you'll encounter in practice. The weekly limit would be a
  secondary indicator for power users.

  Ready to switch to Sonnet 4.5 for implementation when you are!

  > OK how do I do that? Do I simply do /model and switch? Or do I 
need to provide the current context for Sonnet 4.5? 

⏺ You can simply use /model to switch to Sonnet 4.5 - the
  conversation context is preserved automatically when you switch
  models within Claude Code!

  Just type /model and select Sonnet 4.5. The new model will have
  access to our entire conversation history, including:
  - Our discussion about adding Claude support to your logger
  - The rate limiting information
  - The implementation plan I prepared

  No need to provide any context manually. After you switch, you
  can tell me to proceed with the implementation and I'll start
  working on adding Claude support to your logging system based on
   the plan we discussed.

...

 Perfect! Now let me install the required packages and test the
  implementation. First, let me check if the packages are already
  installed:
